# Moving balls

##Description
This file is reguarding the moving ball exercise. In this exercise the balls are moving at the same speed but are changing colors and sizes randomly upon hitting the edges of the contained space.

##Installation
There is not particular process to install this, just download the file and open it on browser.

##Roadmap
Hoping to build more comlex animation like this and raise the bar a little more.
